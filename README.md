# klipper-cfg-troodon

These are the klipper configuration files for my personal Vivedino Troodon 300. They are heavily based on [Robs](https://github.com/robthide37) work from [Advanced 3D Printing](https://www.advanced3dprinting.com/).

You can find the originals in his [components](https://github.com/robthide37/components) repository. His kind of tidyness unfortunately does not fit mine, so here is a compressed configuration that fits me and my printer.

Please check out Robs stuff first since he has a manual and this is just my external brain.
